# Realnaps Code of Conduct

## 1.0 Our Pledge

# 

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## 2.0 Our Standards

# 

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

*   Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
    
*   Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
    
*   Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
    
*   Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
    
*   Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
    

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind

## 3.0 Enforcement Responsibilities

# 

The leadership team is responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

The leadership team has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## 4.0 Reporting

# 

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the People Team Specialist or any member of the Management team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
