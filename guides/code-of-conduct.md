# Realnaps Code Culture & Principles

## 1.0 Philosophy

# 

This document outlines the core principles that guide our engineering practices at Realnaps. Our goal is to build high-quality, secure, and maintainable software. This requires more than just writing code that works; it requires a shared commitment to a professional engineering culture.

## 2.0 Core Technical Principles

### 2.1 Strictly Object-Oriented (OOP)

# 

This is the foundational principle of our codebase. All code, whether it is backend PHP or client-side Node.js, must be designed and written following proper Object-Oriented principles.

*   **Encapsulation:** Objects should be self-contained and hide their internal state, exposing only what is necessary through clear interfaces.
    
*   **Inheritance and Composition:** Use inheritance where it makes sense for "is-a" relationships, but favor composition for "has-a" relationships to build flexible and decoupled systems.
    
*   **Polymorphism:** Design to interfaces, not implementations, to allow for interchangeable components.
    

### 2.2 Security is Non-Negotiable

# 

As a company that handles user data and interacts with financial platforms, security is our highest priority. It is not an afterthought or a feature; it is a prerequisite for all development.

*   **Think Like an Attacker:** Actively consider how your code could be exploited. Sanitize all inputs, validate all data, and follow the principle of least privilege.
    
*   **Follow Best Practices:** Adhere to industry best practices for the technologies you are using (e.g., OWASP Top 10 for web development).
    
*   **Dependencies:** All third-party libraries and dependencies must be vetted and kept up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
    

### 2.3 Clarity and Maintainability Over Premature Optimization

# 

We write code for humans first, machines second.

*   **Readable Code:** Your code should be clean, well-formatted, and self-documenting where possible. Use clear variable and method names.
    
*   **Keep it Simple:** Avoid overly complex or "clever" solutions when a simpler, more straightforward approach will suffice. A future developer (which might be you) will thank you for it.
    
*   **Document the "Why":** The code explains _how_ something is done. Use comments and documentation to explain _why_ it is done that way, especially for complex business logic or non-obvious decisions.
    

## 3.0 Ownership and Accountability

### 3.1 Code Owners

# 

Each repository has a `CODEOWNERS` file that designates primary reviewers for different parts of the codebase. These individuals are responsible for maintaining the quality and integrity of their designated code.

### 3.2 You Build It, You Run It

# 

Developers are expected to have a sense of ownership over the features they build. This includes not only writing the code but also ensuring it is properly tested, documented, and performs as expected in production. When a bug is found in your feature, you are the first line of defense in fixing it.
